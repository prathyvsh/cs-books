* Some notes on progression

The progression here makes use of a spiral curriculum like one where you get exposed to a distinct perspective to computer science and then keep looking at from different angles till you get one full revolution.
Once a full coverage is received, we repeat from the first part again but this time with slightly tough topics to learn.
