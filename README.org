* Learn Computer Science from First Principles
A curation of stand alone books that helps a beginner to learn about computers from first principles.

** Introduction

This is a list of computer science books we have compiled after prospecting this field for around 8 years now. We have stratified the list by popular domains of computer science, so you might not find a stats/probability/category theory book here even though they have strong undercurrents and practical applications in CS. Our estimate is that by reading this list, one will come to have a broad and deep foundation for understanding the cutting edge theory and practice of CS today. We would love to hear from you if we have missed any must-reads or hidden gems. [[https://twitter.com/prabros][Tweet to us]] if you know about one!
