* Learn Computer Science from First Principles
A curation of stand alone books that helps a beginner to learn about computers from first principles.

** Introduction

This is a list of computer science books we have compiled after prospecting this field for around 8 years now. We have stratified the list by popular domains of computer science, so you might not find a stats/probability/category theory book here even though they have strong undercurrents and practical applications in CS. Our estimate is that by reading this list, one will come to have a broad and deep foundation for understanding the cutting edge theory and practice of CS today. We would love to hear from you if we have missed any must-reads or hidden gems. [[https://twitter.com/prabros][Tweet to us]] if you know about one!

** Criteria

*Self-contained*: The book should stand alone in giving up a well-rounded view on a certain area of Computer Science. So the ones that unlock access to other books are thus given priority over ones with pre-requisites.

*Accessibility*: Books that are accessible and less intimidating for a newcomer are chosen. Some of the books here require some pre-requisite learning to get going and in such a case, relevant details are provided on how one can go about mastering the requisites. This is the reason why HtDP is chosen over SICP.

*Fundamentals*: Books that teach fundamentals are chosen over ones that teach a particular technology. This is done because of shearing of layers whereby, latest technologies change really fast, but fundamentals stay stable over long periods of time.

*Fun*: Books that treat the subject in a creative fun way are chosen over encyclopediac canons/surveys that catalog the state of art. This is the reason Udi Manber features over other encyclopediac manuals in the field.

*Big Picture*: It should give one an umbrella view of the subject in hand and give enough depth to make them literate about the subject.
